I built my portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to make it interactive and responsive. I designed it to showcase my skills, projects, certifications, and contact information in a clean and user-friendly layout.

I used:

HTML for structuring the content (like about me, projects, skills, contact).

CSS (with Flexbox and Grid) for styling and responsive design.

JavaScript for features like smooth scrolling and interactive elements.

I also integrated mailto: links for direct contact and made the layout mobile-friendly.

This website helps me highlight what I’ve done and what I’m capable of — like a digital resume and portfolio in one place.
